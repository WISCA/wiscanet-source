[Mongoose](https://www.cesanta.com/mongoose) is a
multi-protocol networking library written in C.
It provides easy to use event-driven interface that allows to implement
network protocols or scalable network applications  with little effort.
Mongoose helps developers to manage the complexity of network programming
and let them concentrate on the logic, saving time and money.

Mongoose has built-in support for several protocols, like
HTTP, Websocket, MQTT, mDNS. Example applications include
Websocket-based chat server, JSON-RPC server,
database server with RESTful API, MQTT broker, netcat with SSL and hexdump,
Raspberry PI camera video feed + led control, and more.

Mongoose is ideal for the embedded environments, it has been designed as
an open source platform for connecting devices and bringing them online.

# Licensing

Cesanta made Mongoose open source under GPLv2 for a reason. We are all
developers here and appreciate easy access to code and therefore seamless
integration. It's great to be able to play around with the software before
committing to it.

However, the GPLv2 open source license does not permit incorporating the
software into non-open source programs. In order to comply with GPLv2 licensing
you need to open the source code of your end product fully or alternatively
purchase a commercial license.
